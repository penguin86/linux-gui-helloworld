# Linux GUI hello worlds

This repository contains some simple programs to demonstrate the usage of the principal graphics libraries used in Linux (GTK and Qt).
The language used is Python 3.

## TODO:
- Add an example using Glade for designing GTK interfaces
- Replicate the same programs in other programming languages
